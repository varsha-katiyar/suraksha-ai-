# 🛡️ suraksha-ai — India's Intelligent Road Safety Command System

> **Road Safety Hackathon 2026 | IIT Madras**
> *AI-Powered Accident Detection, Real-Time Blackspot Mapping, and Emergency Dispatch*

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

India witnesses over **1.5 lakh road accident fatalities annually** — one death every 3.5 minutes. The primary causes include delayed emergency response, lack of real-time accident data, absence of severity assessment at the reporting stage, and poor coordination between traffic authorities and emergency responders. The critical "**Golden Hour**" — the first 60 minutes after an accident — is lost due to fragmented systems.

**suraksha-ai** solves this by providing a **unified, AI-driven command interface** that detects accidents, assesses severity in real-time using Gemini AI, and dispatches emergency resources within seconds — all from a single platform.

## 🎯 What is suraksha-ai?

**suraksha-ai** (Hindi: सुरक्षा — meaning "Protection" / "Safety") is an end-to-end **Intelligent Road Safety Command System** built for India's highways and urban roads. It combines:

- 🤖 **AI-Powered Severity Analysis** — Gemini Vision AI analyzes accident photos to classify severity and recommend resources
- 📍 **Real-Time Incident Mapping** — Interactive 3D globe and Leaflet maps for live incident tracking
- 🚨 **Golden Hour SOS** — One-tap emergency dispatch with nearest hospital routing
- 📊 **ML Hotspot Engine** — Identifies accident blackspots using spatial clustering and temporal analysis
- 🔄 **Escalation State Machine** — Automated incident lifecycle management from detection to resolution
- 🌦️ **Weather Risk Integration** — Real-time weather-correlated risk scoring
- 🗣️ **Multilingual Voice Navigation** — Voice-guided emergency instructions in 10+ Indian languages
- 📰 **Live News Intelligence** — AI-filtered road safety news aggregation
- 🏥 **AI Resource Recommendation** — Smart allocation of ambulances, fire brigades, and police units

## 🚀 Quick Start (For Judges)

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** ≥ 18.x
- **Python**: recommended **3.11 or 3.12** (works best on Windows)
- **pip** (Python package manager)

> Note: On Windows, using very new Python versions (e.g. 3.14) may force some packages (like `pydantic-core`) to compile from source, which requires Visual Studio C++ Build Tools. If you hit install errors, switch to Python 3.11/3.12.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..

# Install backend dependencies (using venv)
python -m venv .venv

# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Start the Application

```bash
# Terminal 1 (frontend)
cd frontend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 (backend) — from project root
# (use your venv python, e.g. .venv\Scripts\python.exe on Windows)
python -m uvicorn backend.app:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

This starts both:
- **Frontend** → http://localhost:5173
- **Backend API** → http://localhost:8000

### Step 3: Login

| Role  | Email             | Password   |
|-------|-------------------|------------|
| Admin | admin@demo.com    | demo@123   |

> **Note:** The admin login works offline with no external database required. All data is stored locally in `backend/local_db.json`.

## 🔐 Offline-First Design

suraksha-ai is designed to work **completely offline** — no cloud database, no external API keys required for core functionality:

- **Database**: All data is stored in `backend/local_db.json` using a custom MockSupabase engine
- **Media Storage**: Images, videos, and audio are saved to `backend/uploads/` and served via FastAPI static files
- **Authentication**: Demo admin login works locally via localStorage
- **Frontend ↔ Backend**: The frontend communicates with the local backend at `localhost:8000` for all CRUD operations

This ensures **judges can run the full application** by simply:
1. Installing dependencies (`npm install` + `pip install`)
2. Running `npm run dev`

---

## 📊 Key Innovations

1. **Three-Stage AI Pipeline**: Detect → Analyze → Respond in under 60 seconds
2. **Gemini Vision Triage**: Upload an accident photo and receive instant severity classification with resource recommendations
3. **Golden Hour Optimization**: Real-time countdown timer with nearest trauma centre routing
4. **ML Blackspot Detection**: Spatial clustering identifies dangerous road segments before accidents happen
5. **Escalation State Machine**: Automated incident lifecycle ensures no incident is missed or forgotten
6. **Multilingual Emergency Response**: Voice-guided instructions in 10+ Indian languages break language barriers during emergencies
7. **Weather-Correlated Risk**: Real-time weather data enhances accident probability scoring
8. **3D Command Interface**: Immersive Three.js globe with real-time crisis markers provides situational awareness
